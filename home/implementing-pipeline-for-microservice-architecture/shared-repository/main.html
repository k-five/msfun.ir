        <p>Why do not we just push the <stirng>built code</stirng> directly to the production serer?</p>
        <p>For example simply using <strong>rsync</strong> via SSH we can send it.</p>
        <p>The reason is simple: we want that others can also code / interact with our repository.</p>
        <p>If you just keep it / them offline on our local machine, no one use it / them. Yes some developers on the same company can, but how about outside of the company?</p>
        <p>Shared repository not only helps doing that, but also can been seen as a backup for our codes.</p>
        <p>So based on previous step which was continuous integration, we add another step to our process which is a shared repository; it can one or more than one depending upon our needs.</p>
