        <p>Why do not we just push the <stirng>built code</stirng> directly to the production server?</p>
        <p>For example simply using <strong>rsync</strong> via SSH we can send it.</p>
        <p>The reason is simple: we want that others can also code / interact with our repository.</p>
        <p>If we just keep it / them offline on our local machine, no one can use it / them. Yes some developers in the same company can, but how about outside of the company?</p>
        <p>Shared repository not only helps doing that, but also can been seen as a backup for our codes.</p>
        <p>So based on previous step which was continuous integration, we add another step to our process which is a shared repository; it can be one or more than one depending upon our needs.</p>

        <p>So if you have code under Version Control then put it on GitHub or somewhere else to have a shared repository.</p>
        <p>We use the Web-Hook of this shared repository to notify our CI Server so our code on the server can be synchronized with GitHub repository.</p>

        <p>Zoom out the screenshot to see it clearly.</p>
        <p>Here I pushed to GitHub (bottom Window) and nodepost (top window) are synchronizing itself with the shared repository in GitHub.</p>
        <p>We will add more layers in the next post, continuous deployment. Lets go.</p>
