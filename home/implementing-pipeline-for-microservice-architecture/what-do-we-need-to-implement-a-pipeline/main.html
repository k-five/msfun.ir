        <p>If you open any online articles related to pipeline and microservices in which they want to talk about <strong>how a pipeline works?</strong> or watch
        <a href="https://youtube.com">youtube.com</a> free videos or pay to watch premium videos they jump directory to <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> and
        <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> plus <strong>Continuous Development</strong>.</p>
        <p>They say how a pipeline works but they do not say based on what facts this pipeline works?</p>
        <p>The two key concepts which are missed are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Kernel Notification</li>
            <li>File-System Observation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In fact talking about pipeline without talking about those two is like talking about <strong>the Internet</strong> without talking about <strong>TCP: Transfer Control Protocol</strong>.</p>
        <p>Thus not like others we first learn about <strong>Kernel Notification</strong> and <strong>File-System Observation</strong> and what they do. Then based on capabilities that these two give us we can create our pipeline.</p>
