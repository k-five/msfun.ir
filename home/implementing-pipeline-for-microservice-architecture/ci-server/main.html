        <p>We talked about <a href="../task-runners">task runners</a>, right?
        A CI Server in the simplest form is a task runner.
        A task runner, runs some tasks for us based on our need.
        A CI Server is a huge task runner with much capabilities that can managers many tasks.
        </p>
        <p>For example <a target="_blank" href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> is a CI Server.</p>
        <p><strong>What does it do?</strong>. Very simple. We sign-up there and register a task to be run.</p>
        <p><strong>Task for what?</strong>. For a project (= repository) we have.</p>
        <p><strong>Where is this repository?</strong>. Well, on our github account.</p>
        <strong>How does it work with our repository?</strong>. After registering a project for Travis-CI, it wants us to let it to have access to our Github repository.
        Then if we give this access to Travis-CI, on that specific project (= repository) it sets up GitHub-WebHooks.
        Then based on these events have been registered for GitHub-WebHook, GitHub will notify Travis-CI for change and Travis-CI based on the task we give to it, run some tasks for us.
        Then based on the result of tasks, Travis-CI modify a <strong>SVG</strong> file - we have it on our README.md - to show us if the tests /  tasks have been failed or succeeded.

        <h3 class="sub-title">FAQ</h3>
        <p>Is it good to have a CI Server?</p>
        <p>Yes. It help us to separate our build process from our source code and shared repository.</p>

        <p>Do we need a CI Server for our own?</p>
        <p>No, if we have a simple project, but for experimental purpose - fun - why not.</p>
        <p>And if a project is big? There are many services out there, you can search for <strong>CI Servers / Services</strong>.</p>
