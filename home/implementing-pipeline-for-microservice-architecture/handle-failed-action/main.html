        <p>When we have many operations running on the server, there are possibilities of failures. With <strong>microservices</strong> it is vital to be aware of these failures.</p>
        <p>Even a single service failure may cause that other services go wrong.</p>
        <p>Because of this we should find / implement mechanisms to face any failures if they happened.</p>
        <p>Three mechanisms we can do are as follow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitoring</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In this case we monitor our services. For example the UINX/Linux <strong>top</strong> command is a form of monitoring. We do not see much details. Just the overall functionally of the system.</li>
                <li>Also we not do collecte information; we do not keep track of events, etc. Like driving a car. We look at front and go.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>e.g. top</li>
                    <li>e.g. df</li>
                    <li>e.g. lsblk</li>
                    <li>e.g. vmstat</li>
                    <li>e.g. pmap</li>
                    <li>e.g. systemctl status -l service-name</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Logging</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>We cannot rely on just monitoring. Many things can happen behind the scene. And these should be saved / stored for later investigation.</li>
                <li>Also we do / should collect information in this case for keep track of past events or maybe for comparing them.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>e.g. syslog, etc</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Alerting</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>If we work with Travis-CI or others we may have an SVG file on our <strong>READMD.md</strong> file to show the result of build / test / etc. It is kind of status that helps we can be aware of the current state of our project.</li>
                <li>The other kind of alerting is to send notification to whom is in charge of the services.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>e.g. sending emails</li>
                    <li>e.g. sending sms</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Ways for Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>CLIs like top, vmstat, etc I named above. These has no interface and not easy to work with for everyone.</li>
            <li>GUI like ntop for Network Monitoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Ways for logging</h3>
        <p>Usually tools have their own mechanism for save / store inputs / outputs / status of what we have to a Hard-Disk.</p>
        <p>And we can code a tool to do the same.</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Ways for Alerting</h3>
        <p>We can email ourselves, others, anyone to notify them about current state of a service. The problem with emailing is that we have to check it each time; whether we have new one(s) or not.</p>
        <p>Texting (sms) is another kinds of notifications that is very fast and is directly delivered to us. No checking. Short and simple; But it cost money.</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Open the Innovation Doors</h3>
        <p>We are not restricted to choose a specific kinks of tool for alerting. For example I thought about <strong>Twitter API</strong> which we can use to post on Twitter.</p>
        <p>Or we can use <strong>HTML5 WebSocket API</strong> to implement some sort of <strong>Real-time Monitoring</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Monitoring Example</h3>
        <p>htop command</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Logging Example</h3>
        <p>Ubuntu <strong>cat /var/log/syslog</strong></p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Email Notification Example</h3>
        <p>From the server to my email account. And on my local machine I am running a bash script that every 1 second (= polling) checks my email INBOX using <strong>curl</strong> command.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="/build/img/02-13-alerting-remote-to-local-communicatin-via-emailing.png" alt="02-13-alerting-remote-to-local-communicatin-via-emailing.png" />
        <p>Here is a curl command that can check our INBOX:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">curl --url "imap://mail.domain-name.com/" --user "my@email-address.com:my-password" --request "EXAMINE INBOX"</code></pre>
        <p>It is pretty fast, on average takes about 350ms.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">SMS API Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const your-api-provider = require('your-api-provider');
const api = your-api-provice.a-function-calli({apikey: 'your-key'});
...
some logic here 
...
api.Send({ message: "Message to send" , sender: "api provide line for sending SMS" , receptor: "your-phone-number" });
</code></pre>

        <p>Notice that we just scrathced the serface of this area! You should research more.</p>
