        <p>While in <strong>Monolithic Architecture</strong> we have a little or not so much operations, in Microservices we have many.</p>
        <p>For example we have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Source Code</li>
            <li>Some kind of Tests</li>
            <li>Maybe Building Locally</li>
            <li>Shared Repository</li>
            <li>CI Server</li>
            <li>Production Serer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then multiply these by number of services we may have, for example 10.</p>
        <p>Plus we usually have team-pre-services (= Cross Functional Team), which means a team is responsible for a service, then we have many repeatable operations for our products.</p>
        <p>If we somehow do not create / find a pipeline for these operations then we will have headache + high-waisted time, energy, etc.</p>

        <p>Thus our goal is implement a road with which our source code can be delivered to our end-user.</p>
        <p>And these steps (how many we have) from <strong>source code</strong> to <strong>end users</strong> should be done effectively which in really means in a <strong>automated</strong> way.</p>
        <p>So our pipeline simply means: multi-steps that have been automated from our source code to deliver our product to our end-user.</p>
