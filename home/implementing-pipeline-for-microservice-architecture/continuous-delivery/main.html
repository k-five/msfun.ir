        <p>Continuous Delivery is another step we add to our pipeline in which we deliver our production code to the end-users.</p>
        <p><strong>This step is a Business Decision and not Technicals Decision.</strong></p>
        <p>We may have some features at production level ready for end-users, but we do not want to show / deliver them to the end-users.</p>

        <p>For more about it you can (to me, should) watch Martin Fowler talk about Continuous Delivery on youtube.com</p>
        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/aoMfbgF2D_4?list=PL_akDzx9nCAElfjdB_h2qM9wALdJ1kOeM">Martin Fowler â€“ Continuous Delivery</a></p>
        <p>The start of the video is about it, the rest is about Continuous Deployment and Continuous Integration too.</p>
        <p>Also the books the Martin Fowler talks about: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20">Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</a></p>
        <p>Or see <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/">ontinuousdelivery.com</a></p>
        <p>That is it. Lets move to CI Server.</p>
