        <p>Continuous Delivery is another step we add to our pipeline in which we deliver our production code to the end-users.</p>
        <p>This step is a Business Decision and not Developers Decision.</p>
        <p>We may have some features at production level ready for end-users, but we do not want to show / deliver it to the end-users.</p>
