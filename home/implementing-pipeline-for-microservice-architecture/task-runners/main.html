		<h1>task-runners</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Okay, at this point we no longer encounter / talk about <strong>low level</strong> things like Kernel and Observation.</p>
        <p>At this point we are at the level of such a tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>gulp</li>
            <li>webpack --watch</li>
            <li>webpack-dev-server</li>
            <li>etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tools are simple task runners and work based on what we saw the in previous posts.</p>
        <p>They are made of three thinks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>a mechanism for watching like: <strong>polling</strong> or <strong>watching</strong></li>
            <li>a mechanism to register events</li>
            <li>a mechanism to run command based on that events</li>
        </ol>
        <p>if we can create such a thing, then we have a task runner. Notice that they can be very simple or very very complex; but the main idea is based on these simple things for automation.</p>
        
        <img src="" alt="applicaton-level-task-runners.png">

        <p>Of course we can use many ready-to-use tools out there, but the goal is to understand how it works under the hood.</p>
        <p>For example we can use <strong>webpack --watch</strong> when we want to bundle our JS files, but how about when we have php file? How about HTML file? Even how about when we have C file? Text file?</p>
        <p>Based on what we have learned so far - if we could not find our tool - we can make our own!</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Our First Simple Pipeline <sup>automation at application level</sup></h3>
        <p>In this pipeline for modifying a HTML file - and after each save - our browser should be refreshed.</p>
        <p>So we need a HTML file; create one.</p>
        <p>Open it with your editor.</p>
        <p>Then for our <strong>command runner</strong> I am using <strong>direvent</strong> and you can find many of them and use them but <a href="http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/direvent">direvent</a> is the best one among CLIs.</p>
        <p>How to find them? Search your OS repository which for <strong>Ubuntu</strong> is something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">apt-cache search monitor | grep file</code></pre>

        <p>Assuming you have direvent, and opened browser (=filefox) and a HTML file, save this configuration file for direvent:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">syslog {
    facility local0;
    tag "direvent";
    print-priority yes;
}

watcher {
    # use your own path not mine
    path /var/www/html/front-end/msfun.site/home recursive;
    file "*.html";
    # for some editor kernel notify "create"
    # for some write my editor "creates" so change this accordingly
    event create;
    command "/usr/bin/xdotool search --onlyvisible  --class firefox key F5";
    # command "/usr/bin/xdotool search --onlyvisible --class chromium-browse windowfocus key --window 0 F5";
    option (stdout, stderr, wait);
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This configuration file says, on this path: "/var/www/html/..." recursively <strong>watch</strong> all html files and whenever a <strong>create</strong> happened, run <strong>xdotool</strong> command.</p>
        <p>save this file under the name of <strong>browse-refresh.conf</strong> and then run direvent in this way on your Terminal</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">direvent --foreground browser-refresh.conf </code></pre>

        <p>the foreground option is just for running it interactively  with the shell. If we do not use this, by default direvent will be run as a <strong>daemon (= service)</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you did everything correctly, then after each <strong>save</strong> your browser will be refreshed.</p>
        <p>Make sure to understand what are happening here because with these task runners we can create / design a much bigger pipeline (= we should) for our microservices.</p>
