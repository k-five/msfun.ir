        <p>Continuous Deployment is not that hard if we understood Continuous Integration.</p>
        <p>Because it expands the process further up to the production.</p>
        <p>In fact we add more steps to our pipeline so the source code can be ready for production in a automation way.</p>

        <img src="/build/img/02-10-continuous-deployment.png" alt="02-10-continuous-deployment.png" />
        
        <p>While our continuous integration has been automated at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Application Level Automation</li>
            <li>Architecture Level Automation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>with continuous deployment we have to think about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Infrastructure Level Automation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example our local machine should <strong>push</strong> to Github and then Github sends <strong>notification</strong> to CI server for building, then CI server sends <strong>notification / files</strong> to production server.</p>
        <p>You can see some of these levels are outside of our control::</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Github</li>
            <li>CI Server, like buddy, Travis-CI, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fortunately these services have implemented some APIs that help us to interact with them. For example Github has <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Github Webhook</a>.</p>
        <p>So we are doing the same but in a larger scale. Instead of using our task runners, we use  Github's APIs - that also under the hood - Github's servers have some kind of task runners for watching our repositories.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Architecture Level Automation</h3>
        <p>Assuming that Github is our <strong>shared repository</strong> we just need to register for a WebHook on Github for our CI Server (if we have it) or others CI Servers which is done by that service for us.</p>
        <p>Here is a screenshot of <strong>msfun.ir</strong>:</p>
        <img width="100%" src="/build/img/02-09-github-webhook-for-msfun.png" alt="02-09-github-webhook-for-msfun.png" />
        <p>after each:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>push</li>
            <li>pull request</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Github will send a notification to: "http://msfun.ir/gitpush" via HTTP as a POST.</p>
        <p>Since my process is simple and experimental, I used the save server for both:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CI Server</li>
            <li>Production Server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But for large project a separate CI Server is preferable.</p>
        <p>One the other side, our CI server or my microservice that I have with Node.js should always listen for Github push notification.</p>
        <p>You can see it <a href="https://github.com/k-five/nodepost/blob/4fd467209e044637e34ed6f29339a53ac114626a/nodepost.js#L102">here</a> in nodepost source code.</p>
