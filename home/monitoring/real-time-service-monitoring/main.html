        <p>Here is a demo for real-time service monitoring. I will elaborate its implementation when had time to do so.</p>
        <p>It is not too complicated. Just pairing Web Socket Clients to Web Socket Servers. The web socket server will push all it has been set for to client side in real-time.</p>
