        <p>This model of organizing teams is the old one in which we organize teams around / based on <strong>Job Function</strong>.</p>
        <p>What is job function? Simple. The position the people take to do a specific job.</p>
        <p>In this model we really do not have a team. What do you have then? A group of related positions.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="/build/svg/team-01-incidental-couplied-team.svg" alt="team-02-reverse-conway-maneuver.svg">
        <p>And these people are organized around / based on their jobs. So we have <strong>front-end team</strong>, <strong>back-end team</strong>, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Conway's Law</h3>
        <p>We have a very interesting law named <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conways's Law</a>.</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</p>
            <p>M. Conway</p>
        </div>
        <p>What does it mean?</p>
        <p>The software and application we design is kind of a system, right? If we have bad organized organization and communication, then this reflect to our code and finally our application.</p>
        <p>Usually we will end up having <strong>N-tiered Layered</strong>.</p>
        <p>And not surprisingly having <strong>Monolithic Architecture</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Focus of the team</h3>
        <p>In this model <strong>focus</strong> of the team is not on <strong>value</strong> nor is it on <strong>products</strong>.</p>
        <p>Where is the focus on then? I do not know :(.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Project</h3>
        <p>In this model someone (= could be CTO, PM, etc) gives a team or a person a task or a portion of code to be completed by them; and they will do it.</p>
        <p>The developers in this model code and deliver the code to whoever gives them the task. </p>
        <p>Who should care about the rest of the operation to the code?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>deployment</li>
            <li>testing</li>
            <li>building if we have any kind of it</li>
            <li>etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Usually the person who get the code! The <strong>hero</strong>, the <strong>super man</strong> of the company.</p>
        <p>So how about front-end developers or back-end, etc? Hmmm ... No one cares.</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Problem</h3>
        <p>Okay what is the problem with this model?</p>
        <p>The first one to me is <strong>wasting time to deliver code</strong>. Read this: <a target="_blank" href="../you-build-it-you-run-it">You build it, you run it</a>.</p>
        <p>The second one is not having a <strong>Pic Picture</strong> in mind of the developers about the overall of the application or the software they coded.</p>
        <p>The third can be not feel responsible for code after deliver it.</p>
        <p>etc.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Solution</h3>
        <p>Very simple. <a href="../inverse-conway-maneuver">Inverse Conway Maneuver</a></p>
