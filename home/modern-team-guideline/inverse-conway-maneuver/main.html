        <hr>
        <p>With the inverse of conways's maneuver, instead of focusing on developers job function, we focus and <strong>products</strong>.</p>
        <p>Instead of saying we have <strong>project to finish</strong> we say we have <strong>product to deliver</strong>.</p>
        <p>And instead of organizing developers based on their job title, e.g front-end, back-end, we organize them based on <strong>Bounded Context</strong>.</p>
        <p>Bounded Context is one of keys in DDD (= Domain Driven Design).</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Team</h3>
        <p>In this model teams are not based on a specific position, e.g all front-ends developers but on the requirements of a service or product we have.</p>
        <p>We have a service that needs only one person? So that person will take the responsibility of that service. One other service needs a <strong>designer</strong>, a <strong>front-end</strong>, a <strong>back-end</strong>, an <strong>Oracle Database Specialist</strong>? Then these four become a team for that service.</p>
        <p>Focus is on the product, deliver product and not code or deliver source code to someone else!</p>
        <p>So the goal is to have an <strong>autonomous team</strong> that can take care of their source code till putting it on production.</p>


        <h3 class="sub-title">Responsibility</h3>
        <p>In this model we give developers much more responsibility than the old model we discussed in other posts. That is way the CTO of Amazon says: <strong>You build it, your run it</strong>.</p>
        <p>You start the source code, so you should take care of it till deliver it to production server.</p>
        

        <h3 class="sub-title">Pipeline</h3>
        <p>Because of these model many interesting things come up.</p>
        <p><i>E.g how a front-end developer can deliver code?</i></p>
        <p>This is where <strong>Development Operation</strong> (= DevOps) comes to the play. And not just physically but also culturally.</p>
        <p>Having a pipeline helps teams or organizations to know where they are going.
        Also which and how many steps they have before they could deliver their product / value to their customer.</p>
        <p>And good pipeline is based on good <strong>automation</strong>.
        All the key steps from committing to the main / shared repository up to the production server should be automated.</p>
        <p>Every team should be able to deploy every day or even any hour if they want - which usually is.</p>
