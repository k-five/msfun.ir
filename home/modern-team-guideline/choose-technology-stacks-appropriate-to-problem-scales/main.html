        <hr>
        <p>Nowadays that we have variety of technologies - specially open source - it makes hard to choose the right one.</p>
        <p>The right choice is not to choose the best in terms of fully featured one, but the one which is best for our needs.</p>
        <p>The <strong>size</strong> of the problem we have, the <strong>complexity</strong> of the solution we need, the <strong>amount of time</strong> we want to use a technology, are some keys to choose an appropriate technologies.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Simplicity</h3>
        <p>This blog that you are reading it is using a simple JSON file as its <strong>database</strong>.</p>
        <p>And here is the database:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
    "home": {
        "why we got into microservice architecture": "",
        "implementing pipeline for microservice architecture": {
            "what is a pipeline for microservices": "",
            "what do we need to implement a pipeline": "",
            "quick look at final result": "",
            "kernel notification": "",
            "file system observation": "",
            "task runners": "",
            "continuous integration": "",
            "shared repository": "",
            "continuous deployment": "",
            "continuous delivery": "",
            "ci server": "",
            "handle failed action": "",

        },
        "modern team guideline": {

            "inverse conway maneuver": "",
            "prefer collaboration over categorization": "",
            "choose technology stacks appropriate to problem scales": "",
            "prefer guidance over governance": "",
            "prefer automation to ad-hoc verification": "",
            "prefer subscriptions to milestones": ""
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>We should not choose a technology because we <strong>feel</strong> good about, we think it is <strong>cool</strong>, etc. If we can solve it with a simple one, we use that simple one.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">different services</h3>
        <p>If we have different services - which usually they are - then we should not think of the same database for all services we have. If we can pass over it by using a simple JSON file we will do that.</p>
        <p>If for a service we need <strong>mongoDB</strong> then we do not use JSON and will choose mongoDB, of course.</p>
        <p>So the scale of our problems, or needs determines which technologies we should choose..</p>
