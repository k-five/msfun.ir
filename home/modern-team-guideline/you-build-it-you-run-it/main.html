        <p>I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khooger.com/">Khooger</a> about 3 months and 18-19 days less or more; pretty short.. No single byte I coded there pushed to the production.</p>
        <p>After that the entire team changed because the product manger wanted to and they switched to <a target="_blank" href="https://magento.com/">Magento</a></p>
        <p>The company (= Khooger) paid me, plus insurance and other benefits but what values I added to their code / product / website? Zero.</p>

        <p>I coded and the CTO said "okay it is good. Store it somewhere I will put it in ...</p>
        <p>I coded and the CTO said "okay it is good. Store it somewhere I will put it in ...</p>
        <p>I coded and the CTO said "okay it is good. Store it somewhere I will put it in ...</p>
        <p>Really! I did this for more than 3 months and finally I quit</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Code and deliver it to me!</h3>
        <p>The old way of developing software in most organizations is that someone comes in, starts to code and delivers it to <strong>someone else</strong>. This "someone else" can be PM, or CTO. etc.</p>
        <p>Since in this model the developers are not given the responsibilities of their works; they just code and deliver it to someone else.
        A common pattern mostly in <strong>Monolithic Architecture</strong> we can see and still exists.
        </p>
    
        <p>Usually in this model the organization does not have <strong>pipeline</strong> or any kind of <strong>automation operation</strong> and things are done manually.
        Also they do not push <strong>new code and features</strong> to production frequently and because of this huge huge amount of code should be pushed at once.
        </p>
        <p>And <strong>big chuck of code</strong> deployment almost always has the risk of breaking the old code / service or whatever we have.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">You build it, you run it</h3>
        <p>Amazon started to change their monolithic architecture at about 2000 towards <strong>microservice architecture</strong>.</p>
        <p>In about 2004 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Vogels">Werner Vogels</a> joined Amazon.</p>
        <p>His famous quote <strong>you build it, you run it</strong> is the way of describing a software developer responsibility.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="/build/svg/you-build-it-you-run-it-cto-of-amazon.svg" alt="you-build-it-you-run-it-cto-of-amazon.svg" />

        <p>In this way, developers do not just code and sit around. They test, deploy, etc and in fact they take care of the pipeline of their codes.</p>
        <p>How mush time does it take to deploy the code? Very little. Everything has been automated and deployment equals just pushing to the main repository or merging to master branch.</p>
        <p>How many days does it take to push to production code? Zero. They can push to production everyday or even every hour if they want.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Good team, Good organization</h3>
        <p>A good team or good organization do not grab code from their developers and then push it to production.</p>
        <p>They have <strong>pipeline</strong> and <strong>automation</strong>.
        Developers code and after they commit their code, using Version Control System, an automated system helps them to push the code they wrote to production.
        </p>
        <p>Testing has been automated. Deployment has been automated. Building has been automated. Monitoring has been automated.</p>
        <p>So they code, test, deploy, build, and monitor over and over again.
        No code delivers to PM, CTO, etc and this is the right our team, developers, organization should follow.</p>
