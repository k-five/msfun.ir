        <p>Imagine a King that wants to control everything and everybody.
        We can name this behavior <strong>Centralized Governance</strong>.
        In this model one person tries to dictate everything to others</p>
        <p>The inverse of this model is to have several people - e.g a Congress - so the
        decisions can be made by discussing and not dictating. We can name this behavior
        <strong>Decentralized Governance</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Monolithic versus Microservices</h3>
        <p>Now if we, our team, our company has a <strong>Large Code Base</strong> that
        controls every aspect of the application, business, or software we have - in the
        same manger like the king - then we have a <strong>Monolithic Architecture</strong>.</p>
        <p>The inverse of this model can be, breaking down key functionalities of our large code
        base to small - almost - independent chucks of code. Doing so we can have
        <strong>Service Based Architecture</strong> which in a precise and modern team we
        can call it <strong>Microservice Architecture</strong>.</p>
        <p>Does it make sense when we have a Congress, then just one person decides to dictate
        everything? No.</p>
        <p>The same is true for Developing Software.</p>
        <p>When we break our large code base to smaller services, and we give each service to 
        a person, or a team to manage, then it does not make sense to force them to
        <strong>choose</strong> a specific <strong>Technology Stack</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Guidance and not Governance</h3>
        <img width="100%" src="/build/svg/team-06-prefer-guidance-over-governance.svg" alt="team-06-prefer-guidance-over-governance.svg" />
        <p>This rule emphasizes on NOT to force a team to follow a <strong>Hero</strong> in the 
        company whoever who might be.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CTO</li>
            <li>PM</li>
            <li>etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Teams should be able to choose the technology that want to develop their services
        based on.</p>
        <p>Not doing so means while physically we have a Microservice Architecture but 
        culturally we have a Monolithic Architecture.</p>

        <p>As a manager when we give our teams position, we should give them freedom to
        choose, too.</p>
        <p>This is true for example for <strong>Implementation Stack</strong>, but not
        for <strong>Monitoring</strong>. Because in terms of monitoring, for the entire services
        we have, we should have consistency.</p>
        <p>Therefore it is preferable to be <strong>guidance</strong> for our teams / developers
        and not <strong>governance</strong>. E.g forcing everybody / every team to use / choose <strong>MongoDB</strong> as their database is not preferable.</p>
