        <p>At the early age of developing application specifically Web Application the rate of change in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>libraries</li>
            <li>frameworks</li>
            <li>programming language</li>
        </ul>
        <p>was low.</p>
        <p>Business planners or Software Architectures could plan for long time; <strong>strategic planning</strong>, in which the business would decide each phases and steps ahead of time.</p>
        <p>Because we did not have rapid change in Technology Stack, we could count on our plans.</p>
        <p>But in modern world (= web development) when every month a JavaScript library comes out, then this kind of <strong>Long Term Planning</strong> will put businesses in high risk of failure then before.</p>
        <p>In is not just about JavaScript, many technologies are changing rapidly, and because of these high rate of change we no longer are able to plan for very long time.</p>
        <p>Also making a decision about every steps we have in our development life-cycle / environment is not as easy and simple than past.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Open for change</h3>
        <img width="100%" src="/build/svg/team-07-prefer-subscriptions-to-milestones.svg" alt="team-06-prefer-guidance-over-governance.svg" >
        <p>Instead of having concrete steps in our mind towards future and implementations, it is better to listen to changes that happen and are going to happen in the future.</p>
        <p>Having a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> will blind us and not paying attention to changes will finally kicks us out of the business or market!</p>
        <p>The solution is not about having no plans or no scheduling, but it is about willing to accept new opportunities if they can solve our problems simpler, more efficient, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">falling in love with your programming language, technology, etc</h3>
        <p>I have seen and heard developers say:</p>
        <p class="quote">I am using <strong>PHP</strong> more than 15 years and not going to change it. <strong>Node.js</strong> does not have any values.</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p class="quote">We are an enterprise business and we do not use any e-commerce platforms other than <strong>Magento</strong>!</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p class="quote">I hate <strong>C++</strong>. It is a trouble language.</p>
        <p>Instead we should say which one is better for our needs? PHP or Node.js?</p>
        <p>Which one solves our problems better?</p>
        <p>Focus on and try to see the <strong>values</strong> of a technology and NOT on your <strong>feeling</strong> about that technology.</p>
