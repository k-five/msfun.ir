        <p>Human's mind during its history evolved to be interested about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>guessing</li>
            <li>prediction</li>
            <li>forecasting</li>
            <li>etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>whereas we will grow more if we do things practically, test them and get feedback from them; then improve defects, and test and getting more feedback.</p>

        <p>Software architectures over time realized that as much as they have a <strong>Big Up Front Design</strong> they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>grow harder and slower!</li>
            <li>the source code after a while does not match the original model of the software!</li>
            <li>after a while we are behind market and technologies and have to change plans again!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In fact this is one of main reasons we tried to move from old software development model to <strong>Agile</strong> world.</p>
        <p>In agile we do not guess! We do not predict too far nor do we forecast about users need. We <strong>release</strong> frequently. We get feedback. We fix and release over and over again.</p>
        <p>I highly recommend seeing this video by Martin Fowler and Neal Ford on youtube, specially the first part of it.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">new technology</h3>
        <p>As much as we face new technologies and as much as we face many competitors, <strong>prediction</strong> becomes harder and harder and focusing on <strong>evolving</strong> will be a better choice.</p>
        <p>This is what many giant companies did. Started small, adapted over time and grow.</p>
        <p>Also that is why - in recent years - something like <a target="_blank" href="http://evolutionaryarchitecture.com/">Evolutionary Architecture</a> emerged.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">evolve</h3>

        <p>Saying <strong>do not predict</strong> does not mean <strong>do not have any plans for the future.</strong> Nor does it mean <strong>do not think about the future</strong>.</p>
        <p>Not only we should thing about the future but also we should have some sense / ideas  of what will happen next.</p>
        <p>The point is we should not <strong>rely</strong> on just pure thinking, pure guessing, pure planning, etc.</p>
        <p>That is why Google has over <strong>12,000 A/B Tests</strong> during a year. Google tests its idea many many times.</p>
        <p>Thus we should try to reduce just</p>
        <ul>
            <li>thinking</li>
            <li>planning</li>
            <li>designing</li>
            <li>guessing</li>
            <li>predicting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and involving ourselves to more</p>
        <ul>
            <li>testing</li>
            <li>getting feedback</li>
            <li>releasing frequently</li>
            <li>adapting</li>
        </ul>
